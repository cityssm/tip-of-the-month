# Maintain Access to Your Online Accounts

**Tip of the Month - July 2024**

Last month, I was asked to help a neighbour set up a new computer.
Unfortunately, their older one quit working entirely.
Thankfully, the older machine was used mostly for browsing Facebook and checking emails,
so no files were lost, but there was one problem.

**They didn't remember any of their passwords.**
They had them saved in their browser, but not backed up or synced anywhere, so they were gone.

Onward to password recovery. Onward to a huge roadblock. ðŸš§

When originally setting up Facebook, the person used an email address offered through their
Internet Service Provider (ISP) at the time. Fast forward to today. They have a different
ISP, and no access to that email address.

We've sent an email to Facebook support for assistance, but I'm not holding my breath.

## Don't Let it Happen to You!

**Consider using a password manager, and keeping it backed up.**<br />
Many web browsers can remember your passwords, but if you are not using the browser's
password syncing services, then be sure to periodically back up those saved passwords.
Alternatively, consider a service or application to manage your passwords,
and keep the records backed up.

**Consider using email services NOT from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).**<br />
It's hard to change your email address, especially if you need to update it with a significant
number of contacts and services.
Don't get locked into your ISP just because of your email address.
There are lots of free options out there,
like [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)
or [Outlook.com](https://outlook.live.com/mail/about/index_en.html) (formerly Hotmail).

**If you do change your email address, update your online services.**<br />
Just like getting a new credit card and updating all of your preauthorized payments,
it is important to update your online services when your email address changes.
Not only is it important to the account recovery process,
but it's also sometimes used for two-factor authentication.

**If the online service additional recovery options, use them.**<br />
Maybe they offer a series of security questions.
Maybe they accept a phone number, or a secondary email address.
Whatever the choices are, take advantage of them.

**If the online service is being used for business purposes, use a business email address.**<br />
This will make it far easier for your IT department to assist with account recoveries
if need be, especially if, for example, the recovery involves an email address which no longer exists.
