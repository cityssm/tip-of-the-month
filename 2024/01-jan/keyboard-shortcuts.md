# Keyboard Shortcuts in Windows

**Tip of the Month - January 2024**

Not every application you use has toolbars with copy and paste options,
or right-click popup menus with the options you need.
Knowing a few keyboard shortcuts can massively improve your productivity,
and a lot of them aren't too tough to remember.

ðŸ’¡ Note that these keyboard shortcuts are for Windows,
though other operating systems, like Mac and Linux, do use some of them as well.

## How to Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Some keyboard shortcuts, like `F1` for help, are a single key. Just press the key, and you're good to go.
Others are multiple keys. When multiple keys are involved,
press and hold the modifier keys, like `Ctrl`, `Alt`, or `Shift` first,
then press the other keys.

## Clipboard Management

Copying and pasting is so important when it comes to moving things from one place to another.
These shortcuts work in web browsers, office applications, and throughout Windows.

| Shortcut     | Description                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl` + `X` | Cut _(Note that X looks like a pair of scissors.)_        |
| `Ctrl` + `C` | Copy                                                      |
| `Ctrl` + `V` | Paste _(Note that V is next to X and C on the keyboard.)_ |

## Document Management

| Shortcut     | Description                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl` + `S` | Save _(I regularly use this one between paragraphs in documents. Power blips happen!)_ |
| `Ctrl` + `Z` | Undo _(Keep pressing to continue undoing.)_                                            |
