## About this Project

Working in IT, questions come across our desks every day.
Some of those questions may seem trivial to someone with a bit of savvy in the subject matter,
but the simple answers can sometimes drastically change how a coworker does their work
and solves their problems.

Rather than just sending then discarding those mini how-tos,
this project shares them with the hope to empower users with the answers to the questions
they may think are too silly to ask.
