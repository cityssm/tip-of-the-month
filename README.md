## About this Project

Working in IT, questions come across our desks every day.
Some of those questions may seem trivial to someone with a bit of savvy in the subject matter,
but the simple answers can sometimes drastically change how the person asking does their work
and solves their problems.

Rather than just sending then discarding those mini how-tos,
this project shares them with the hope to empower users with the answers to the questions
they may think are too silly to ask.
